# Gatsby + Greenhouse Job Board Starter

This project will get you started displaying a list of open jobs, office pages, department pages, and job posts. Job posts load the Greenhouse Job Application via iFrame but you may choose to build your own application form submission for which there are a minimal set of React components to render the form.

## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed and updated) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName http://github.com/wahyufaturrizky/greenhouse-job-board-app
npm install && gatsby develop
```
